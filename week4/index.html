        <h3>Novice to Ninja Chapter 8- Forms</h3>
        <p>Most of us use forms every day to log in to our favorite sites. They are a very common method of interaction.
            They are made up of a "form" element and have controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons.
            Traditionally information gathered from a form was esnt to a 'back end' language such as PHP or Ruby. It's
            becoming more and more common to process informaiton in a form on the 'back end'.</p>
        <h4>Simple Search Example:</h4>
        <form name='search' action='search.html'>
            <input name='searchInput'>
            <button type='submit'>Search</button>
        </form>
        <p>You can reference forms in the document (in the order they appear using) "document.forms". This can be used
            in combination with other useful things. "form.elements" can be used to access the colection of elements
            within forms. You can also access the form controls using ther name attributes for example:
            "form.searchInput". Squar bracket notation can also be used "form['searchInput'].</p>
        <ul>Form Properties, Methods and Events:
            <li>form.submit() method - automatically submits the form.</li>
            <li>form.reset() method - reset controls back to inital values. A button with a type attribute of reset can
                also be used.</li>
            <li>form.action property - can set the action attribute of a form (so it is sent to a different URL).</li>
            <li>focus event - occurs when an element is focused on.</li>
            <p>const input = form.elements.searchInput; <br> input.addEventListener('focus', () => alert('focused'),
                false);</p>
            <li>blur event - occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form.</li>
            <li>change event - occurs when the user moves the focus away from the form <i>after</i> changing it.</it>
            </li>
            <li>submit event - possible the most important form event.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Text input element objects have a "value" property that can be used to retrieve the text inside the field.
            <strong>Think about the example: </strong><br><br> function search(event) {
            <br> alert(`You Searched for: ${input.value}`);
            <br> event.preventDefault();
            }
        </p>
        <p>Javascript can also be used to set the value. Like: "input.value = 'Search Here';". The problem with this is
            that the text remains in the field when the user clicks inside it, so it has to be deleted before the user
            can enter their own text. This is easily remedied using the focus and blur event handlers. Similar
            functionality can be produced in modern browsers using the placeholder attribute.</p>
        <ul>Form Controls (these should look familiar):
            <li>input</li>
            <li>select</li>
            <li>textarea</li>
            <li>button</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Example using form controls:</h4>
        <form id='hero'>
            <label for='heroName'>Name:
                <input type='text' id='heroName' name='heroName' autofocus placeholder='Your Super Hero Name'
                    maxlength=32>
            </label>
            <button type='submit'>Submit</button>
            <label for='donation-amount'>Enter amount to donate:
                <input type='text' id='donation-amount' name='donationAmount' value='10'>

        <h3>Novice to Ninja Chapter 12- Object-Oriented Programming in JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a style of programming that involves separating code into objects that
            have properties and methods.</p>
        <ul>Juicer Metaphor:
            <li>Encapsulation -- You can press on or off but how the machine works is all inside. With encapsulation you
                keep programming logic inside an object making methods available to implement without the outside world
                needing to know how it is done.</li>
            <li>Polymorphism -- Many other appliances have an on/off button but each one works slightly different. In
                OOP this means various objects can share the same method. They can also override shared methods with
                amore specific implementation if needed.</li>
            <li>Inheritance -- Upgrades People! Taking the features of one objec then adding new features that improve
                functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Enumerable Properties - properties of objects in JavaScript are said to be enumerable or non-enumerable. If
            they aren't enumerable, this means they will not show up when a "for-in" loop is used to loop through an
            object's properties and methods.</p>

        <h3>Novice to Ninja Chapter 15: Modular Javascript- Modern JavaScript Development</h3>
        <p>Javascript library - a piece of code that provides several methods that make it easier to achieve common
            tasks without having to use repetitve code.</p>
        <p>Libraries (such as jQuery) are often well-tested and resistent to bugs that may be difficult to work with.
            Along with this they unify standards. For example configuring event listeners to work with older browsers.
        </p>
        <p>jQuery is a very powerful and polished library that provides a considerable number of useful methods. It has
            become so popular that many online tutorials assume you’re using jQuery rather than just JavaScript.</p>
        <p>Underscore & Lodash are very similar libraries. They have a large number of utility functions under the
            namespace "_". It is worth considering using one of these. Lodash can be thought of as a 'superset' of
            Underscore.</p>
        <ul>Advantages of Libraries:
            <li>Used by lots of people</li>
            <li>Thoroughly tested</li>
            <li>Optimized & Battle tested</li>
            <li>Will ensure wide browser functionality</li>
            <li>Online documentation</li>
            <li>Online community</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Disadvantages of Libraries:
            <li>Larger amount of code for a website to download</li>
            <li>Performance issues if code is too large</li>
            <li>Could fail to implement the functionality in the precise way you want</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Be careful not to rely on a library and find that you’re learning how to use the library's methods, rather
            than the language itself. A library should not be used because of a lack of understanding of JavaScript.</p>
        <p>As modules have become more widely used in JavaScript, there’s been a need for tools to manage them. Package
            managers allow developers to download modules from a central repository.</p>
        <p>When you install a package using npm it will become a dependency of your project by default.</p>
        <p>Content delivery networks (CDNs) are systems of distributed servers that can deliver web resources, such as
            JavaScript, CSS or image files to a user based on their geographic location.</p>
        <p>Rather than use separate .js files you should combine all the scripts into a single minified and compressed
            file. This file is often named 'bundle.min.js' to signify that it’s a number of files bundled together and
            has also been minified.</p>
