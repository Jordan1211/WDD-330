        <h2>Week 1 Notes</h2>
            <h3>Portfolio Creation</h3>
                <p>Github pages turned on, github desktop set up, javascript created for quick updates to weekly list.</p>
                <p><strong>Can all notes be turned in through giving a link to the home page?</strong></p>
            <h3>Master Mobile UX Sitepoint Course</h3>
                <p>Doing large frst rather than mobile first is like trying to put a marshmallow into a piggy bank.</p>
                <p>The number of devices as well as turnover devices have changed drastically with mobile devices. Mobile traffic has increased greatly, hence <strong> MOBILE FIRST </strong> importance.</p>
                <P>Responsive doesn't always mean mobile first. Retrofitting is making your site work with mobile. It may be a good temporary alternative to a rebuild if necessary.</P>
                <ul>Things to Remember:
                    <li>Desktop computer sales have been declining since 2011</li>
                    <li>You don't see people with their heads in laptops</li>
                    <li>Start small and scale up</li>
                    <li>Mobile is not a fad</li>
                </ul>
                <p>People don't know what they want.</p>
                <p>Be There, Be Useful, Be Quick</p>
                <p>Reachability matters - with Mobile first. Think of one handed and two handed grip. What is hard to get to?</p>
                <p>Speed Matters - slow and more clicks is a drop in traffic, revenue and overal useage.</p>
                <p>Reduce images, use SVG/Webfonts, optimize and minify css and js files, use gzip files to eliminate unecessary data.</p>
                <p>Be empathetic to users and consider primary controls of mobile devices. Good enough isn't good enough! This includes reachability, placement, and consideration of universal understanding.</p>
                <p>For forms simplicity and required information is important to consider. "Reduce cognitive load".</p>
                <p>Difficulty in forms often leads to complete abandonment of the task.</p>
                <ul>Useful tips:
                    <li>Auto-complete</li>
                    <li>Using intutive design<li>like auto progress credit card information like in the example</li></li>
                    <li>Auto progress through form</li>
                    <li>Password difficulty consideration</li>
                    <li>Number only input consideration (switch to number only keyboard)</li>
                    <li>Phone numbers with a link (rather than causing them to copy/paste)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Advertising can be evolved with technology.</p>
                <p>Pop ups should be avoided.</p>
                <p>If you place ads in content, make them small! You can make them small at first and grow once clicked.</p>
                <p>Be creative with ads like using a background window that shows when scrolling.</p>
                <p>Users don't visit your website to look at ads.</p>
                <p>Content should come first.</p>
