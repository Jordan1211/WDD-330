        <h3>Object methods, "this": <a
                href="https://javascript.info/object-methods">https://javascript.info/object-methods</a></h3>
        <p>The value of "this" is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the method.</p>
        <p>Remember: A function that is a property of an object is called its method.</p>
        <p>In JavaScript, keyword this behaves unlike most other programming languages. It can be used in any function,
            even if it’s not a method of an object.</p>
        <p>Arrow functions are special: they don’t have their “own” this. If we reference this from such a function,
            it’s taken from the outer “normal” function.</p>

        <h3>This in JavaScript: <a href="https://zellwk.com/blog/this/">https://zellwk.com/blog/this/</a></h3>
        <p>What is this? It is a keywork whose value changes depending how a function gets called.</p>
        <ul>There are 6 different ways where "this" can take on new values:
            <li>in global context - usually you wouldn't use "this" but the value of this defaults to the "window"
                object.</li>
            <li>in object construction - "this" refers to the instance.</li>
            <li>in an object method - "this" within any method refers to the object iteself.</li>
            <li>in a simple function - "this" is always set to "window", to fix you can make a variable to store the
                reference to "this" or use an arrow function.</li>
            <li>in an arrow function - in an arrow function is always the same as "this" around it.</li>
            <li>in an event listener - "this" is set to the element that fired the event in an event listener.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>"this" is a crucial keyword in JavaScript. It appears in many Javascript frameworks. Some will say don't use
            "this" because it's confusing but it is important to be able to understand and use "this". Articles like
            this one can be used as clarification.</p>

        <h3>Novice to Ninja Chapter 5 - Objects</h3>
        <p>Think of an object as a dictionary where you look up a property name and see a value.</p>
        <p>const spiderman = {}; - is an example of creating an object literal.</p>
        <p>You can access properties of an objects properties by using dot notation or bracket notation.</p>
        <p>New properties and methods can be added to objects at any time in a program. You just assign a value to the
            new property and it will be slotted under the object. Similarly you can change the value of an object's
            properties at any time.</p>
        <p>To remove properties from objects you can use the "delete" operator. <br> For Example: <br> delete
            superman.fly
            <br>^ This removes the fly property of the object superman.
        </p>
        <p>Objects are not ordered lists like an array or set map. They can change order.</p>
        <p>(Once again!) The keyword "this" refers to the object that it is within.<strong> It can be used inside
                methods to gain acess to the object's properties.</strong></p>
        <p>Namespacing can be used to prevent duplication of functions. This duplication can happen if multiple
            developers are working in a library or a large sample of code is worked on for a prolonged time, so
            namespacing can be helpful. Creating a namespace is just making an object that holds the function or
            functions.</p>
        <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is very helpful in being human and machine readable.</p>

        <h3>Novice to Ninja Chapter 6 - Document Object Model</h3>
        <p>The DOM allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interation.The textbook defines this as it
            represents an HTML document as a network of connected nodes that form a tree-like structure. Everything is a
            node!</p>
        <p>The DOM is language agnostic although it is most commonly used with Javascript.</p>
        <ul>DOM Methods- most of these do as their name suggests
            <li>getElementById()</li>
            <li>getElementsByTagName()</li>
            <li>getElementByClassName()</li>
            <li>querySelector() - allows you to use the CSS notation to find the first element in the document that
                matches. Note that suedoselectors can be used example: 'li:last-child'</li>
            <li>querySelectorAll() - allows you to use the CSS notation to find all the elements in the document that
                match.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>Navigating the DOM tree with properties:
            <li>childNodes</li>
            <li>children</li>
            <li>firstChild</li>
            <li>lastChild</li>
            <li>parentNode</li>
            <li>nextSibling</li>
            <li>previousSibling</li>
            <p>These methods find the node not the element. Using these properties allows you to navigate around the
                whold document tree.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>Various different getter and setter methods can be used to reference attributes. For example: getAttribute()
            and setAttribute() </p>

        <h3>Novice to Ninja Chapter 7 - Events</h3>
        <p>Events are another part of the DOM and they are what provides the link between the web page and user
            interactions. Clicking on a link, pressing a key or moving a mouse can be detected and responded to.</p>
        <p>Think of event listeners as alarms of sorts. They notify us of something happening so we can configure what
            happens once that something happens.</p>
        <h4>Old ways to avoid:</h4>
        <p>Inline event handlers used to be the way to go (think of the onclick="" attribute). This however isn't
            recommended. Another older way is to use event handler properties that all node objects have
            (document.onclick for example).</p>
        <h4>Use Event Listeners!</h4>
        <p>The current and recommended standard is to use Event Listeners. They are supported in all modern browsers,
            separate HTML form JS and help with organization.</p>
        <ul>addEventListener() Types of Events
            <li>Mouse Events
            <li>click</li>
            <li>mousedown</li>
            <li>mouseup</li>
            <li>dblclick</li>
            <p>Remember avoid using click and doubleclick event on the same element.</p>
            <li>mouseover</li>
            <li>mouseout</li>
            <li>mousemove</li>
            </li>
            <li>Keyboard Events
            <li>keydown</li>
            <li>keypress</li>
            <li>keyup</li>
            <p>Properties included: shiftKey, ctrlKey, altKey, metaKey</p>
            </li>
            <li>Touch Events
            <li>touchstart</li>
            <li>click</li>
            <li>touchend</li>
            <li>touchmove</li>
            <li>touchenter</li>
            <li>touchleave</li>
            <li>touchcancel</li>
            <p>Properties included: touches and length</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>An event listener can be removed using the removeEventListener() method.</p>
