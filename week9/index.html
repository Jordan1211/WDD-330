        <h3>Novice to Ninja Chapter 9 - The Window Object</h3>
        <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain
            information about the browser and computer screen. It can also be used for popups (althought these should be
            avoided).</p>
        <p>Remember that JavaScript can be run in different environments. The BOM only makes sense in a browser
            environment. This means that other environments (such as Node.js) probably won’t have a window object,
            although they will still have a global object; for example, Node.js has an object called global. If you
            don't konw the name of the global object you can use something like <i>const global = this;</i></p>
        <p>Some functions we’ve already met, such as parseInt() and isNaN(), are actually methods of the global object,
            which in a browser environment makes them methods of the window object.</p>
        <p>3 functions that produce dialogs in the browsers are: alert(), confirm() and prompt(). These are not part of
            the ECMAScript standard, although all major browsers support them as methods of the window object.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The window.alert() method will pause the execution of the program and display a message in a dialog box.
                The message is provided as an argument to the method, and undefined is always returned.</li>
            <li>The window.confirm() method will stop the execution of the program and display a confirmation dialog
                that shows the message provided as an argument, and giving the options of OK or Cancel. It returns the
                boolean values of true if the user clicks OK, and false if the user clicks Cancel.</li>
            <li>The window.prompt() method will stop the execution of the program. It displays a dialog that shows a
                message provided as an argument, as well as an input field that allows the user to enter text. This text
                is then returned as a string when the user clicks OK. If the user clicks Cancel, null is returned.</li>
            <li><strong>WARNING: these methods will stop the execution of a program in its tracks. This means that
                    everything will stop processing at the point the method is called, until the user clicks OK or
                    Cancel. This can cause problems if the program needs to process something else at the same time or
                    the program is waiting for a callback function.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The window object has a number of properties and methods that provide information about the user’s browser.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>window.navigator - The Navigator object contains information about the browser being used. Its userAgent
                property will return information about the browser and operating system being used. (remember that this
                can be altered by the browser so it can be inaccurate)</li>
            <li>window.location - The window.location property is an object that contains information about the URL of
                the current page. It contains a number of properties that provide information about different fragments
                of the URL.</li>
            <ul>
                <h4><strong>window.location properties</strong></h4>
                <li>The href property returns the full URL as a string</li>
                <li>The protocol property returns a string describing the protocol used (such as http, https, pop2, ftp
                    etc.). Note that there is a colon (:) at the end</li>
                <li>The host property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL and the port number
                    (this is often omitted if the default port 80 is used)</li>
                <li>The hostname property returns a string describing the domain of the current URL</li>
                <li>The port property returns a string describing the port number, although it will return an empty
                    string if the port is not explicitly stated in the URL</li>
                <li>The pathname property returns a string of the path that follows the domain</li>
                <li>The search property returns a string that starts with a “?” followed by the query string parameters.
                    It returns an empty string if there are no query string parameters</li>
                <li>The hash property returns a string that starts with a “#” followed by the fragment identifier. It
                    returns an empty string if there is no fragment identifier</li>
                <li>The origin property returns a string that shows the protocol and domain where the current page
                    originated from. This property is read-only, so cannot be changed</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h4><strong>window.location methods</strong> </h4>
            </ul>
            <li>The reload() method can be used to force a reload of the current page. If it’s given a parameter of
                true, it will force the browser to reload the page from the server, instead of using a cached page</li>
            <li>The assign() method can be used to load another resource from a URL provided as a parameter</li>
            <li>The replace() method is almost the same as the assign() method, except the current page will not be
                stored in the session history, so the user will be unable to navigate back to it using the back button
            </li>
            <li>The toString() method returns a string containing the whole URL</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The window.history property can be used to access information about any previously visited pages in the
            current browser session.</li>
        <ul>
            <h4><strong>window.history properties</strong></h4>
            <li>The window.history.length property shows how many pages have been visited before arriving at the current
                page</li>
            <li>The window.history.go() method can be used to go to a specific page, where 0 is the current page</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Each window object contains a document object. This object has properties and methods that deal with the page
            that has been loaded into the window. In Chapter 6, we covered the Document Object Model and the properties
            and methods used to manipulate items on the page.</p>
        <p>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a user’s computer. They were invented by Netscape as a way
            of getting round HTTP being a stateless protocol. This means that a browser does not remember anything from
            one request to another. So every time a user visits a page, nothing about any previous visits is remembered.
            Cookies can be used to sidestep this problem by storing information that can then be retrieved between
            requests.</p>
        <p>The window object provides some useful methods for scheduling the execution of a function, and for repeatedly
            executing functions at regular intervals.The window.setTimeout() method accepts a callback to a function as 
            its first parameter and a number of milliseconds as its second parameter. It can also cancel the timeout 
            using the window.clearTimeout() method. The window.setInterval() method works in a similar way to 
            window.setTimeout(), except that it will repeatedly invoke the callback function after every given number of
            milliseconds.</p>
