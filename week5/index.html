        <h3>Novice to Ninja Chapter 10 - Testing and Debugging</h3>
        <h4>Errors</h4>
        <p>System error - there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting.
        </p>
        <p>Programmer error - the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a
            typo.</p>
        <p>User error - the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.</p>
        <h4>Exceptions</h4>
        <p>An exception is an error that produces a return value that can be used by the program to deal with the error.
        </p>
        <p>Stack traces help you find where an erorr orignates from. Remember the example:
            <br>function three(){ unicorn(); }
            <br>function two(){ three(); }
            <br>function one(){ two(); }
            <br>one();
            <br>
            <br><i>output:</i>
            <br>index.html:13 Uncaught ReferenceError: unicorn is not defined
            <br>at three (index.html:13)
            <br>at two (index.html:17)
            <br>at one (index.html:21)
            <br>at index.html:24`
        </p>
        <h4>Warnings</h4>
        <p>A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This
            means the program will continue to run after a warning.</p>
        <p>Warnings may be problematic because the program continues to run. This can be avoided with proper user
            testing.</p>
        <h4>Why is Testing and Debugging Important?</h4>
        <p>Failing gracefully rather than silently is the goal. When you fail silently things can be missed and
            overlooked than cause issues down the road.</p>
        <p>Strict mode can be used in order to increase the ability to catch errors. When you aren't in strict mode you
            are in "sloppy mode" because sloppy proctices can sneak through</p>
        <p>To use strict mode place 'use strict'; at the top line of your js file. You can also place 'use strict';
            inside a function.</p>
        <p>The suggested way to do this is:
            <br>(function() {
            <br>'use strict';
            <br>
            <br>// All your code would go inside this function
            <br>
            <br>}());
        </p>
        <p>Linting tools are a great way to adhere to certain conventions. There are online or add-on linters that can
            be used.</p>
        <p>To find if browser supports a certain feature you can use an if statement a library like Modernizir or
            broswer sniffing. This is refered to as "Feature Detection"</p>
        <h4>Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them.</h4>
        <p>This is usually done with manual coding or using developer tools to set breakpoints. Alerts can return the
            value of a certain variable. The console can also be used to do the same thing. Most modern browsers have
            debugging tools that can be used.</p>
        <p>The 'debugger' keyword will create a breakpoint in your code that will pause the execution of the code and
            allow you to see where the program is currently up to. You can also hover over any variables to see what
            value they hold at that point. <strong>You should be sure to remove references to the debugger command before deploying.</strong></p>
        <ul>Error Objects:
            <li>Error</li>
            <li>EvalError</li>
            <li>RangeError</li>
            <li>ReferenceError</li>
            <li>SyntaxError</li>
            <li>TypeError</li>
            <li>URIError</li>
            <li>InternalError</li>
            <li>URIError</li>
            <p>Properties for these in most browsers are "name", "message" and "stack".</p>
        </ul>
        <p>You can throw your own exception using the 'throw' statement. You can also manually code a try and catch blocks to be a sort of error handler. The try holds a piece of code we think may fail. The catch block can pass then pass the error if that happens.</p>
        <h4>Test, Test and Test Some More!</h4>
            <p>By testing with system, programmer and user errors in mind you can avoid headaches in the future.</p>
            <ol>Test-driven development (TDD) is the process of writing tests before any actual code. The process for this is as follows:
                <li>Write tests (that initially fail)</li>
                <li>Write code to pass the tests</li>
                <li>Refactor the code</li>
                <li>Test refactored code</li>
                <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You can make your own tests but this can be a hard task. To help with this Testing Frameworks have been developed.</p>
